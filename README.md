## Mod Ideas

### Controller Convenience
Reposition some of the UI buttons when using a controller to be easier, quicker, or otherwise more convenient to use.

Examples:
  * Chest quick-stack (and the other buttons)
  * ...

### Deposit to Nearby Chests
Adds a button on side of player backpack UI to quickly deposit items to chests within a nearby range.

When button is selected/hovered over, show a tooltip that says "Deposit to: _ _ _", where each _ would be a render of a nearby chest (including its color)

Config:
  * Deposit all backpack rows, including first row
  * Nearby range
  * Render nearby chests in button tooltip
